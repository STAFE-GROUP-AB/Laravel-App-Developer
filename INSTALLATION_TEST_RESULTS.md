# Testing Package Installation Locally

This script demonstrates how to test the Laravel App Developer package installation.

## Test Results Summary

- ❌ **Package not available on Packagist** (main issue)
- ✅ **Package structure is valid**
- ✅ **Composer.json validates correctly**
- ✅ **Git tag v0.1.0 exists**
- ✅ **Can be installed via VCS repository**

## Main Issue

The error "Could not find a matching version of package stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer" occurs because:

**The package has not been submitted to Packagist.org**

## Solution

1. Submit the package to Packagist.org manually:
   - Go to https://packagist.org/
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Submit repository: https://github.com/STAFE-GROUP-AB/Laravel-App-Developer

2. After submission, the normal installation will work:
   ```bash
   composer require stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer --dev
   ```

## Alternative Installation (Works Now)

Users can install via VCS repository:

```bash
composer config repositories.laravel-app-developer vcs https://github.com/STAFE-GROUP-AB/Laravel-App-Developer
composer require stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer:^0.1 --dev
```

## Files Added/Fixed

- ✅ Fixed composer.json type to "library"
- ✅ Updated README with alternative installation
