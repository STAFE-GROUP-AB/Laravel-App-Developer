# Packagist Submission Guide

## Summary
The Laravel App Developer package installation issue is confirmed: **The package is not available on Packagist**. This is why users get the "Could not find a matching version" error.

## Test Results

✅ **Package structure is correct**
- Valid composer.json
- Proper PSR-4 autoloading
- Service provider configuration
- Git tag v0.1.0 exists
- LICENSE file added
- Package type set to "library"

❌ **Package not on Packagist** 
- `composer require stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer --dev` fails
- Package cannot be found in any public repository

## Solution: Submit Package to Packagist

### Steps to Fix the Installation Issue

1. **Go to Packagist.org**
   - Visit https://packagist.org/
   - Sign in with GitHub account

2. **Submit the Package**
   - Click "Submit" button
   - Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/STAFE-GROUP-AB/Laravel-App-Developer`
   - Click "Check" to validate
   - Submit for indexing

3. **Verify Submission**
   - Wait for Packagist to index the repository
   - Check that the package appears at: https://packagist.org/packages/stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer

4. **Test Installation**
   - After Packagist indexing, test: `composer require stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer --dev`

### Auto-Update Setup (Recommended)

Set up GitHub webhook to auto-update Packagist:
1. In Packagist package settings, copy the webhook URL
2. In GitHub repository settings, add webhook:
   - Payload URL: (from Packagist)
   - Content type: application/json
   - Events: Just the push event

## Alternative Installation Methods (Temporary)

Until Packagist submission is complete, users can install via:

### Method 1: VCS Repository
```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/STAFE-GROUP-AB/Laravel-App-Developer"
        }
    ],
    "require-dev": {
        "stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer": "^0.1"
    }
}
```

### Method 2: Direct Installation
```bash
composer config repositories.laravel-app-developer vcs https://github.com/STAFE-GROUP-AB/Laravel-App-Developer
composer require stafe-group-ab/laravel-app-developer:^0.1 --dev
```

## Files Added/Modified

- ✅ Added `LICENSE` file (MIT License)
- ✅ Added `phpunit.xml` for testing
- ✅ Added basic tests in `tests/` directory
- ✅ Added `type: "library"` to composer.json
- ✅ Created installation test script
- ✅ Validated composer.json structure

## Next Steps

**The primary action needed is to submit the package to Packagist.org** - this is not something that can be automated via code changes but requires manual submission through the Packagist website.
